Neo,

in our mission to drain the machines' energy, Trinity \href{https://nmap.org/movies/matrix/matrix-nmap.mp4}{was able to break into their energy grid} and shut it off.

At least we thought so ...

Somehow, there still is this one big energy plant remaining that can power whole 01 or --- as we call it --- the Maschine city.

We were able to obtain a stable network connection to their API which appears to be based on their custom Matrix protocol --- the inner workings, unfortunately, are unknown to us.

Can you take on this challenge, become root user and shutdown this plant? You're our last hope, Neo.
