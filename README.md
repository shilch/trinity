# CTF-Challenge "Trinity" für HackerContest (PrivEsc)
Konrad Langenberg, Jonas Franz und Simon Hilchenbach

> Neo,
> 
> in our mission to drain the machines' energy, Trinity [was able to break into their energy grid](https://nmap.org/movies/matrix/matrix-nmap.mp4) and shut it off.
> 
> At least we thought so ...
> 
> Somehow, there still is this one big energy plant remaining that can power whole 01 or - as we call it - the Maschine city.
> 
> We were able to obtain a stable network connection to their API which appears to be based on their custom Matrix protocol - the inner workings, unfortunately, are unknown to us.
> 
> Can you take on this challenge, become root user and shutdown this plant? You're our last hope, Neo.
> 
> Morpheus
